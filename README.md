# Invoice Management System

This project is an Invoice Management System implemented in C++. The system allows users to create and view invoices for products. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for adding product details, such as name, price, and quantity, and generates an invoice with a total amount.

## Features

- **Make Invoice**: Allows users to input details for multiple items, including the item name, unit price, and quantity. The system calculates the total price for each item and the overall total for the invoice.

- **Show Invoice**: Displays a prototype of the generated invoice, showing the details of each item, including the item name, quantity, unit price, and total price. It also provides the overall total for the invoice.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option:
    - Press 1 to make an invoice and input product details.
    - Press 2 to view a prototype of the generated invoice.

3. Follow the prompts to enter the required information.
4. Review the generated invoice, and in the case of making an invoice, the overall total.

## Note

- Items once sold cannot be returned.
- The system provides a simple invoice management solution suitable for small-scale businesses or personal use.
